&emsp;&emsp;I started my schooling as the majority did in my area, at the local `primarry` school. I then went to the local `secondarry` school and `recieved` grades in English, Maths, `Phisics`, Biology, Geography, Art, Graphical `Comunication` and Philosophy of `Religeon`. I'll not bore you with the 'A' levels and above.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Notice the `ambigous` English qualification above. It was, in truth, a `cource` dedicated to reading "Lord of the flies" and other gems, and a weak `atempt` at getting us to `commprehend` them. `Luckilly` my middle-class upbringing gave me a head start as I was already `aquainted` with that sort of `langauge` these books used (and not just the Peter and Jane books) and had read `simillar` books before. I will never be able to put that `paticular` course down as much as I desire to because, for all its faults, it introduced me to Steinbeck, Malkovich and the wonders of Lenny, mice and pockets.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;My education never included one iota of grammar. Lynn Truss points out in "Eats, shoots and leaves" that many people were excused from the `rigours` of learning English grammar during their schooling over the last 30 or so years because the majority or decision-makers decided one day that it might hinder imagination and `expresion` (so what, I ask, happened to all those `expresive` and imaginative people before the ruling?).<br>
